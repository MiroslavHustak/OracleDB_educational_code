    Views:    
    Views are explicitly designed to represent a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query. 
    Therefore, they are often given a dedicated folder or section in database management tools for easy identification and management.
    
    Window Functions, Derived Tables, CTEs, and Inline TVFs:    
    These constructs are often considered as parts of queries rather than standalone database objects.
    Window functions, derived tables, CTEs, and inline TVFs are elements within a SELECT statement rather than separately stored entities in the database. 
    They are used within the context of a query but do not persist as separate objects.
    The lack of a dedicated folder for these constructs might be because they are transient and exist only for the duration of the query execution.
